# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

This project is a visualization tool for pathfinding algorithms implemented using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to create and edit mazes, and then visualize the process of finding the shortest path using either the A-star or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.
