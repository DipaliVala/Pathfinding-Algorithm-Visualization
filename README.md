This project is a Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to create custom mazes, select different pathfinding algorithms (A* and Breadth-First Search), and visualize how these algorithms find the shortest path between a start and an end point.

## üåü Features

* **Interactive Maze Creation:**
    * Easily draw walls/obstacles on a grid to create custom mazes.
    * Set custom start and end points for pathfinding.
* **Algorithm Visualization:**
    * Visualize the A* (A-star) algorithm in action.
    * Visualize the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
    * See the explored nodes and the final shortest path highlighted.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**
    * Simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter.
    * Controls to start, reset, and select algorithms.
* **Step-by-Step Visualization:** (Assuming this is a feature, common in visualizers)
    * Observe the algorithm's decision-making process step by step.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **GUI Library:** Tkinter (Python's standard GUI framework)
* **Algorithms Implemented:**
    * A* (A-star)
    * Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations.
    * You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **(Optional)** Any other libraries mentioned in a `requirements.txt` file (if one exists in the repository).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/DipaliVala/Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualization.git](https://github.com/DipaliVala/Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualization.git)
    cd Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualization
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Mac/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Install Dependencies:**
    If there's a `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Note: Tkinter is part of the standard library, so it usually doesn't need a separate pip install unless a specific version or extension is used.)

4.  **Run the Application:**
    Execute the main Python script (e.g., `main.py`, `app.py`, or whatever the entry point script is named):
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *(Replace `main.py` with the actual name of the main script in the repository if different.)*

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Launch the application.**
2.  **Create a Maze:**
    * Click on grid cells to draw walls (obstacles).
    * Designate a start node (e.g., by clicking a button and then a cell).
    * Designate an end node.
3.  **Select an Algorithm:** Choose either A* or BFS from the UI controls.
4.  **Start Visualization:** Click the "Start" or "Visualize" button.
5.  **Observe:** Watch as the algorithm explores the grid and highlights the shortest path found.
6.  **Reset:** Use a "Reset" or "Clear" button to clear the visualization or the entire maze for a new setup.

*(Adjust these usage steps based on the actual UI and controls of the application.)*

## üí° Potential Enhancements / Future Scope

* Implement more pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, DFS).
* Allow users to adjust the speed of visualization.
* Add options for different heuristics in A*.
* Save and load maze configurations.
* Improve UI/UX with more visual cues or themes.
