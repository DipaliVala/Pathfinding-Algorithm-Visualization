# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

This project is a visualization tool for pathfinding algorithms implemented using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to create and edit mazes, and then visualize the process of finding the shortest path using either the A-star or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.

#Features

-Maze Creation: Users can create mazes manually by clicking on the grid or automatically generate mazes using pre-defined patterns.

-Pathfinding Algorithms: Visualizes the A-star and Breadth-First Search algorithms.

-Interactive UI: Easy-to-use interface to select algorithms, control speed, and reset the grid.
